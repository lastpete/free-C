# ASSIGNMENT

This was an assignment from the first class to teach me C, and not designed to be more than a proof of concept assignment.

After the first menu selection, I really enjoyed figuring out how I could sanitize the input (type CHAR vs type INT).

All comments and variable names have changed as requested by the teacher who provided the assignment. Sorry if it is confusing.

## compile and run
	```c
	<COMPILED_PROGRAM>.exe input1.txt input2.txt
	```
